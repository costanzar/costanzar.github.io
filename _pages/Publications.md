    Our study is based on measurements taken in an instrumented computer laboratory classroom from which we develop a CO<sub>2<sub> evolution analytical model for a multi-zone space that accounts for the parametrisation of inter- and sub-zonal mixing. The analysis of the model and data using dynamical system techniques highlights lower dimensional spaces that are representative of the leading processes in the system and the most relevant physical parameters."

    This paper studies the dynamical regimes experimentally developing in a stratified fluid forced by internal gravity waves in a pentagonal domain. We find that by changing the shape and increasing the dimensions of the domain finite-size effects diminish and wave turbulence is observed. In this regime, the temporal spectra decay with a slope compatible with the Garrett-Munk spectra. Different regimes appear by changing the forcing conditions, namely, discrete wave turbulence, weak wave turbulence, and strongly stratified turbulence. The buoyancy Reynolds number Re<sub>b<sub> marks well the transitions between the regimes, with weak wave turbulence occurring for 1<Re<sub>b<sub><3.5 and strongly nonlinear stratified turbulence for higher Re<sub>b<sub>."

    excerpt: "[Transition from geostrophic flows to inertia-gravity waves in the spectrum of a differentially heated rotating annulus experiment.](https://doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-20-0033.1)  <br />
   **Costanza Rodda** and Uwe Harlander (2020).

    doi: https://doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-20-0033.1 <br />
    A long-standing question is what causes the -5/3 slope in the atmospheric spectra at the mesoscale: is it turbulence?  
    Gravity waves? Something else? <br />
    In this work, we use a laboratory experiment-the differentially heated rotating annulus-to investigate the problem. 
    Our experimental spectra show striking similarities to the atmospheric one. By separating the spectra into the vortex 
    and wave component, it emerges that at the large-scale end of the mesoscale the gravity waves observed in the 
    experiment cause a flattening of the spectra and provide most of the energy. At smaller scales, our data analysis 
    suggests a transition towards a turbulent regime with a forward energy cascade up to where dissipation by 
    diffusive processes occurs."

   excerpt: "[A new atmospheric-like differentially heated rotating annulus configuration to study gravity wave emission

    A new configuration of the classical baroclinic annulus experiment, recently built at the BTU laboratory, is presented 
    in this paper. We called this experiment the “atmospheric-like” differentially heated rotating annulus for its 
    characteristic aspect ratio that makes it more similar to the Earth’s atmosphere. <br />
    The first evidence of gravity waves emitted from the baroclinic jet is reported. The conditions for gravity wave 
    emission and propagation in this particular experimental set-up are examined in detail with the support of comparable 
    numerical simulations. It emerges that, due to the complex horizontal structure of the buoyancy frequency N, where the 
    largest values occur along the baroclinic jet axis, the gravity waves in the experiment are observed to be trapped."

    excerpt: "[Baroclinic, Kelvin and inertia-gravity waves in the barostrat instability experiment]( https://doi.org/10.1080/03091929.2018.1461858) <br />
    **Costanza Rodda**, Ion Dan Borcia, Patrice Le Gal, Miklos Vincze, and Uwe Harlander (2018).

    doi: https://doi.org/10.1080/03091929.2018.1461858 <br />
    We investigate a modified version of the classic baroclinic experiment--the barostrat experiment--in which a    
    juxtaposition of convective and motionless stratified layers is created by introducing a vertical salt 
    stratification.  <br />
    The thermal convective motions are suppressed in a central region at mid-depth of the rotating tank, therefore double- 
    diffusive convection rolls can develop only in thin layers located at top and bottom, where the salt stratification is 
    weakest. For high enough rotation rates, the baroclinic instability destabilises the flow in the top and the bottom 
    shallow convective layers, generating cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies separated by the stable stratified layer. 
    Thanks to this alternation of layers resembling the convective and radiative layers of stars, the planetary’s 
    atmospheric troposphere and stratosphere or turbulent layers at the sea surface above stratified waters, this new 
    laboratory setup is of interest for both astrophysics and geophysical sciences."
