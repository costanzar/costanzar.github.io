Hi! I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the [Fluid Mechanics group at Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/fluid-mechanics/people/). The focus of my research is on different applications of thermal and fluid dynamics, including geophysical flows, stratified turbulence, mixing, and energy optimisation in buildings. 

The unifying theme of my PhD and postdoctoral research has been the investigation of stratified rotating flows with laboratory experiments. More specifically, the focus of my work has been on gravity waves, which can be found ubiquitously in the ocean and atmosphere and represent the unresolved dynamics in climate models, resulting in one of the main sources of uncertainties. 

Before moving to London to work at Imperial College, I was in France for a little over a year and worked at [LEGI](http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/web/) in Grenoble. Here, I worked with in the [international collaboration on wave turbulence] (http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/web/) funded by the [Simons Fundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org). Within this project, I investigated internal gravity wave turbulence experimentally. The lab experiments were done in the 13-m large [Coriolis rotating platform](http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/web/spip.php?article757). This is the largest rotating platform in the world solely dedicated to the study of the fluid mechanics!


Besides my academic interests, I am an opera lover and I trained as an opera singer.
