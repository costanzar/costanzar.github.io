Hi! I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the [Fluid Mechanics group at Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/fluid-mechanics/people/), where I am investigating how localised heat sources impact the stratification and tracer transport in ventilated buildings. 

The focus of my research has been on different applications of fluid mechanics spanning from geophysical flows to indoor ventilation.

Before moving to London to work at Imperial College, I was in France for a little over a year and worked at [LEGI](http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/web/) in Grenoble. Here, I worked with in the [international collaboration on wave turbulence] (http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/web/) funded by the [Simons Fundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org). Within this project, I investigated internal gravity wave turbulence experimentally. The lab experiments were done in the 13-m large [Coriolis rotating platform](http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/web/spip.php?article757). This is the largest rotating platform in the world solely dedicated to the study of the fluid mechanics!


Besides my academic interests, I am an opera lover and I trained as an opera singer.
